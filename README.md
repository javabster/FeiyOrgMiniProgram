# FeiyOrgMiniProgram
The aim of this project was to create a WeChat mini program to help users discover the organisations supported by Feiy.co

Users enter the mini program and then can select which category of organisation they are interested in. They are then shown
a randomly generated selection of organisations that fit that category.

Users can swipe left and right to view more organisations within the category.

Each organisation page displays the name, logo and a short description of that organisation. If users wish to learn more about
a specific organisation they can extract the QR code displayed at the bottom of the page which will redirect them to the
primary Feiy.co online platform.

(QR codes can be easily extracted within the Wechat app by long tapping the QR code image)
